\subsection{Bar- and pie chart (black box/GUI)}
\label{subsec:chart}
In the black box the pie charts are automatically saved for each function (see Section~\ref{subsec:blackbox}). Additionally, in the GUI a bar chart is generated, which presents the total weight of each method represented by different colours (Torenbeek: red, Raymer: green, GD: blue). For the GUI, however, the charts are not saved.
