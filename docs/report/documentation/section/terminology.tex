\textbf{Dictionary}\\
Python has something called a \textit{dictionary}, it is used in many other languages as well.
The dictionary is important for this program to store values from the XML file and several other things.
A dictionary is similar to an array, which has elements that can be accessed using index numbers.
For example the first element of the array a = ['apple', 'pear', 'orange'] can be accessed by a[0].
With a dictionary the index numbers are not limited to integers, but also can be strings.
An example of a dictionary is, b = \{'first': 'apple', 'second':'pear', 'three':'orange'\}, 'first' is called the \textit{key} and 'apple' is called the \textit{value}. To get the value 'apple', the corresponding key is specified, b['first'].
