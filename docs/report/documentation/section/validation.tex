\section{Validation}
\label{sec:validation}
Most of the values are taken from the Civil Jet Aircraft Design website~\cite{data} and some other values are estimated or taken from other aircrafts.
The XML input file (provided) contains all the input values, the GUI can also be used to view the input values in a more user-friendly way.
The result of the weight estimation as the following (in Appendix~\ref{sec:outputxml} the output XML can be seen),
\VerbatimInput{code/output.txt}
What is noticable is that the total weight of Raymer is less than that of the other two.
The total weights of Torenbeek and General Dynamics are quite similar, 238,357 lb and 246,080 lb respectively.
The estimated weights under the structures group are quite similar for all three methods, however they simply differ in the propulsion and equipment group.
This is because parameter values in those groups are much harder to find or estimate and some are guessed.

Therefore, based on the results for the weight estimation, Torenbeek and General dynamics are more suitable.
