\section{Output}

\subsection{XML}
The output XML file is generated in the GUI file and makes use of the library \texttt{lxml.etree}.
The three dictionaries with the results of each method are arguments for the export function.
Tags for each method are specified 'torenbeek', 'raymer' and 'general\_dynamics' where the results are placed.
The function looks at the key of the dictionary and sets that as the tag and the value as the value of the element.
For example a dictionary for one method might look like, \texttt{my\_dict = \{'w\_w':100, 'w\_e':200, 'w\_n':300\}}, the function loops through the dictionary and sets the first element as, \texttt{\textless w\_w\textgreater 100\textless/w\_w\textgreater} in the output XML file, and so on.
