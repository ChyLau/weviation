\subsection{XML (black box/GUI)}
The output XML file is generated in the GUI  and black box file  and makes use of the library \texttt{lxml.etree}.
The three dictionaries with the results of each method and one with the aircraft information are arguments for the export function.
Tags for the information and each method are specified as 'info', 'torenbeek', 'raymer' and 'general\_dynamics' where the results are placed.
The function looks at the key of the dictionary and sets that as the tag and the value as the value of the element.
For example a dictionary for one method might look like, \texttt{my\_dict = \{'w\_w':100, 'w\_e':200, 'w\_n':300\}}, the function loops through the dictionary and sets the first element as, \texttt{\textless w\_w\textgreater 100\textless/w\_w\textgreater} in the output XML file, and so on.
When every dictionary element of each method is changed to XML syntax, the file is written as \texttt{output.xml}
Additionally, in the GUI, a dialog function is called, which prompts a dialog message on completion.
