\subsection{Text (GUI)}
\label{subsec:text}
The output text file is generated in the GUI file.
Data in the output data window (middle) of the GUI is written to a .txt file.
This means that the text file contains exactly what is displayed in the output data window.
Again, the dialog function is called, which prompts a dialog message on completion.
